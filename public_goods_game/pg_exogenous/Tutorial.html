       You will play <strong>{{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }}</strong> rounds.
       In each round you are placed into a <strong>firm</strong> (group) of size <strong>2–6</strong>.
       Your firm stays the same for <strong>10 rounds</strong>, then you are reshuffled into a new firm.

   <div class="section">
       <h4>Your decision each round</h4>
       <p>
           You receive <strong>{{ C.ENDOWMENT }}</strong> effort units each round.
           You choose how many units to put into the <strong>firm</strong>.
           The rest you keep for <strong>yourself</strong>.

       <h4>How the firm payoff works</h4>
       <p class="muted">
           Firm payoffs depend on your firm size. In some sessions, the firm payoff also increases more when the firm’s
           <strong>total</strong> effort is higher. Either way, higher total firm effort generally leads to higher firm
           payoffs.

           Interpretation: each unit you contribute to the firm increases <strong>everyone’s</strong> payoff by about α
           points,
